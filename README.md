# Photoship

**Photoship** is a revolutionary image processing tool which allows anyone to
edit images in the most astounding ways!

- Flip the image? No problem!
- Make it black and white? Easy!
- Use AI to give everyone facial tattoos? Planned for a future release!

## Getting started

1. Make sure your machine is set up according to the instructions with

   - [bash](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/bash/)
   - [vscode](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/vscode/)
   - [git](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/git/)
   - [node & npm](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/js/installation.html)

1. Clone the repository (i.e. download it), so you have a copy on your machine.

1. Once cloned, open a terminal in the project folder, and run

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   to install dependencies.

## Running tests

You can test exercises individually using commands like

```bash
npm run test:1a
```

or you can run all tests at once using

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deep dive

Before working on the Photoship project, there are a few things we need to
learn. There are some documentation pages which will teach you what you need to
know, and some exercises for you to practice your skills.
